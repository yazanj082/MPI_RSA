The project focuses on developing and comparing a parallel version of the RSA encryption algorithm against its sequential counterpart. The primary goals include implementing the standard RSA algorithm, measuring its runtime, and then creating an optimized parallel version using MPI and Shared Address Space techniques. This parallel implementation aims to enhance computational efficiency and scalability. The project concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the runtime performance of both versions, plotting these against input sizes to determine computational complexity.
